# Features

## Features Left to Implement
I would like to implement a space for alumni to and converse and post about memories and upcoming events. With this alumni section, I would need to create another user type in the app to restrict access to both the alumni and student platform. Alumni would be able to use the platform as a way to communicate, and the ony one with access to both a superuser.

# Plug-Ins 
If you have the Grammarly plug-in in your browser, when you click on a form's textarea to create or edit a post or comment, the textarea box will jump to the top of the page and then reposition itself into the designated input area on the page. If the plug-in is turned off, there is no issue. Read more about this issue with the Grammarly plug-in [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47957205/textarea-box-moving-on-click-on-initial-page-load).
