# PCSwimming
PC Swimming E-commerce App - Stream 4 Project

This is a **fictional** ecommerce site for a swim team where swimmers can collaborate and pay team fees, and the community can view upcoming events. 

# Demo

# Plug-Ins 
If you have the Grammarly plug-in in your browser, when you click on a form's textarea to create or edit a post or comment, the textarea box will jump to the top of the page and then reposition itself into the designated input area on the page. If the plug-in is turned off, there is no issue.
